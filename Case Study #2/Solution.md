***
### Let's Investigate The Tables First

````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.runners;````
- There are 4 runners and this tables shows their registration date. Nothing to clean 

````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;````
- Exclusions, extras, and order_time column must be cleaned 


````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;````
- pickup time indlcudes the time and data in one column, distance will be changed to miles and duration column will be cleaned up


````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.pizza_names;````
- Only 2 names for ``pizza_id` meat lovers & vegetarians 


````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes;````
- shows the standar set of toppings for each pizza_names


````SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.pizza_toppings;````
- Shows the topping names relevant to the ``topping_id``
